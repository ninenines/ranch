Introduction
============

Purpose
-------

Ranch is a socket acceptor pool for TCP protocols.

Ranch aims to provide everything you need to accept TCP connections
with a small code base and low latency while being easy to use directly
as an application or to embed into your own.

Prerequisites
-------------

It is assumed the developer already knows Erlang and has some experience
with socket programming and TCP protocols.

Supported platforms
-------------------

Ranch is tested and supported on Linux.

Ranch has been reported to work on other platforms, but we make no
guarantee that the experience will be safe and smooth. You are advised
to perform the necessary testing and security audits prior to deploying
on other platforms.

Ranch is developed for Erlang R15B01 and later versions.

Ranch may be compiled on earlier Erlang versions with small source code
modifications but there is no guarantee that it will work as expected.

Versioning
----------

Ranch uses [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/).
